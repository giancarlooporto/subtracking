# 🛡️ SubTracking: The "Shielded Launch" Playbook

When you want to launch a product without using your personal identity or social accounts, you use **"Shielded Launching."** This focuses on the **Product’s Mission** rather than the **Founder’s Identity.**

## 1. Where to Launch Anonymously

### **A. Product Hunt (Pseudonymous)**
*   Create a profile for **SubTracking** or use a pseudonym.
*   In the "Hunter" field, you don't need to be yourself. You can list "SubTracking Team."
*   **The Hook:** "We built a tool that treats your bank data like a secret, not like a commodity."

### **B. Hacker News (Show HN)**
*   This is the best place for anonymous launches. HN users care about the *tech and the privacy*, not who you are.
*   **Post Title:** "Show HN: SubTracking – A local-first subscription auditor using IndexedDB."
*   **Shield Strategy:** If people find a bug, respond from a brand account: *"Thanks for catching that! We've noted the issue and are looking into it. Privacy-first tech has some unique local storage constraints we're constantly refining."*

### **C. Niche Subreddits**
*   Post in `r/privacy`, `r/selfhosted`, or `r/personalfinance`.
*   Use a dedicated Reddit account (e.g., `u/SubTrackingApp`).
*   **Shield Strategy:** Focus on the "No Bank Login" feature. People in these subreddits hate Plaid—they will defend you because you solved their privacy pain point.

## 2. Managing "Glitches" (The Support Buffer)

To avoid personal confrontation, you need a **Support Buffer**.

1.  **Support Email:** All support should go to `support@subtracking.app` (which you can route to your own email).
2.  **Generic Responses:** Never say "I'll fix it." Say **"Our team is investigating"** or **"This has been added to the development queue."** This depersonalizes the work.
3.  **The "Beta" Label:** Even if it's ready, keeping a subtle "Beta" tag or saying "v1.0" in the footer gives you "Grace Period" if a bug appears.

## 3. Passive Growth (The "Set and Forget" Strategy)

If you don't want to "hustle" on social media at all, focus on **SEO Passive Growth**:

*   **The Content Web:** The 10+ pages we built (Compare pages and How-to-Cancel guides) are your "employees." They will work 24/7 to bring in strangers from Google who don't know you.
*   **Directory Listings:** Submit to directories like *IndiePage*, *AlternativeTo*, and *BuiltWithNextJS*. These require zero social interaction after the initial listing.

---

## 4. Brand-Only Social Media
If you MUST have a Twitter, create `@SubTrackingApp`.
*   Post only updates, privacy tips, and discount alerts.
*   Do not link it to your personal profile.
*   Use a brand logo (`logo.png`) as the avatar.

## 5. Visual "Mission" Story
I have updated your home page to use a **"Mission Story"** instead of a "Founder Story."
- It uses **"We"** instead of **"I"**.
- It uses a **Shield Icon** instead of a user photo.
- It protects your identity while keeping the "emotional hook" of why the app exists.
