*   **Title:** Show HN: SubTracking – A privacy-first subscription auditor (Local-first, no Bank Login)
*   **Brand Intro:** "We wanted to build a subscription tracker that didn't violate the user's threat model. SubTracking uses IndexedDB to store everything on the client-side. No API requests to our servers for your financial data. Manual tracking only. We'd love to hear the community's thoughts on the UI and local-storage architecture."
